<font size="+1">The Prairie Garden is located along the Isthmus
Bike Path in the block between Livingston and Paterson Streets.</font>
<p><img src="local01.gif" align="left" border="2" height="463" hspace="2" width="522">
</p>
<p><font size="+1">The garden was started in 1997 as a spare time project.&nbsp;
For several years prairie seeds were scattered in disturbed areas within
the block and weed species were removed.&nbsp; Several woody species exist
in the area of the garden and were periodically trimmed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Starting
in 1999, more active management of the garden was undertaken.&nbsp; With
the assistance of City of Madison Parks personnel, guidelines for planting
and maintenance were developed.&nbsp; In 2000 and 2001 prairie plants were
planted in the garden and seeding with native prairie seed was continued.</font>
</p>
<p><font size="+1">As of December of 2001 I have documented 32 species of
prairie plants and 6 species of prairie grasses.&nbsp; I am in the process
of developing a photo catalogue of the plants so that they can be enjoyed
year round.&nbsp; A start to this catalogue can be found under the "Photo
Galleries" link.&nbsp; Please let me know if you any suggestions.&nbsp;
Thanks.</font>
