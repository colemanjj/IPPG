   <title>Threats to the prairie garden</title>
</head>

<font size=+1>Although the site for this prairie
garden was chosen to avoid conflicts with other uses and other interests,
a number of threats have arisen.&nbsp; So far they have been avoided or
negotiated around.&nbsp; The threats have included:</font>
<p><font size=+1>-- <b>Installation of communications cables</b>.</font>
<br><font size=+1>The land in which the garden is located is classified
as a transportation corridor and is viewed by the communications industry
as a prime route for their communications networks.&nbsp; Over the last
5 years several communications cables have been installed adjacent to the
gardens.&nbsp; This has resulted in repeated soil disturbance and establishment
of weedy species.&nbsp; In the summer of 2001 ATT gained permission&nbsp;
to install a fiber optic cable under the garden.&nbsp; It took vigilance
and effort to prevent destruction of parts of the garden during installation
of the fiber optic cable.&nbsp; In the end the fiber optic project supplied
funds to replace lost plants and to begin the seeding of natives in adjacent
blocks that have been dominated by weeds.</font>
<p><font size=+1>-- <b>Storm sewer maintenance</b>.</font>
<br><font size=+1>The corridor hosts major storm sewers that drain the
Isthmus.&nbsp; In mid-summer of 2001 the City of Madison replaced part
of the storm sewer line in the Livingston to Patterson block.&nbsp; This
required removal of the woody vegetation and some of the grasses and prairie
plants in the western half of the garden.&nbsp; Once completed, the project
resulted in a slight expansion of the garden and the disturbed area was
reseeded with native grasses and forbes. Thanks go to Kari Nichols, City
of Madison Engineer for making this successful resolution possible.</font>
<p><font size=+1>-- <b>Unplanned Mowing.</b></font>
<br><font size=+1>The city has a mowing schedule that is designed to remove
the coarse vegetation from right-of-ways and park-lands that are not regularly
mowed.&nbsp; The prairie garden was not scheduled to be mowed. Unfortunately
there was mis-communication between city parks administration and the mowing
crews and the prairie garden was mowed down in the fall of 2001.&nbsp;
The garden will regrow in the spring but the mowing unfortunately removed
the prairie grasses in their fall prime.&nbsp; There had been potential
for a spring burn of the garden that would have enhanced the prairie plants
but the mowing did not leave enough standing burnable material to sustain
a fire.&nbsp; The mowing schedule for the land adjacent to the Isthmus
Bike Path has been clarified and unplanned mowing is no longer expected
to be a problem.&nbsp; Thanks go to the City of Madison Parks Department
for making this work and for supporting the prairie garden.</font>
<p><font size=+1>-- <b>Sanitary Sewer Installation.</b></font>
<br><font size=+1>In 2002 the Madison Metro. Sewer District (MMSD) will
be installing a new force-main through the Isthmus.&nbsp; The route chosen
follows the Isthmus Bike Path.&nbsp; The installation will result in the
removal and replacement of the bike path with several improvements.&nbsp;
The original plan required ditching and heavy equipment activity for pipe
installation on the north edge of the prairie garden.&nbsp; Discussion
with MMSD and the design engineers, in the summer of 2001, resulted in
a minor redesign that shifted the pipe several feet to the north.&nbsp;
This move made disturbance of the prairie garden unnecessary and protected
several trees from removal. Thanks go to Eric Hjellen of Earthtech and
Bruce Borelli at Madison Metro Sewer District for helping to work this
out.</font>
